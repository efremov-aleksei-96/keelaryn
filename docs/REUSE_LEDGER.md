# Reuse ledger

This file records subsystem-level reuse decisions so later development does not rediscover or silently replace them.

## P0-00 — local read-only discovery

**Decision:** use the Go standard library; add no third-party filesystem dependency.

Reused:
- `path/filepath.WalkDir` for lexical, deterministic tree walking that does not follow symbolic links;
- `os.Lstat` for metadata inspection without resolving symbolic links/reparse-point surrogates;
- `context`, `encoding/json`, `flag`, `os`, `sort` from the standard library.

Why:
- the standard library already supplies the exact minimal read-only traversal semantics required by the spike;
- no third-party dependency improves the current correctness boundary;
- native cross-platform filesystem object identity is intentionally **not** guessed from path/inode abstractions in this slice.

Deferred reuse candidates remain defined in `KEELARYN_CANONICAL.md`: rclone, SQLite/FTS, official MCP Go SDK, fsnotify, MarkItDown, Docling, Tika and later optional components. Each must receive a fresh fit/license/security/API review immediately before adoption.
